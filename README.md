# vehicle-parking-app-mad1
A multi-user parking management system using Flask and SQLite. Users can book 4-wheeler parking spots, and the admin can manage parking lots, users, and reservations.

## Technologies Used

- Flask (Backend)
- SQLite (Database)
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja2 (Frontend)

- ##  Issues Faced & Resolved (Milestone 1) 
1.Issue:-I got confused initially about how the models connect to the database. It took me some time to understand how SQLAlchemy maps Python classes to tables.
Resolution:-I went through examples and slowly and gradually understood it.

2.Issue:- I couldn't understand using 'ForeignKey' and 'db.relationship()'. I wasnâ€™t sure which table should have the foreign key and how exactly the '.realatioship' worked works.
Resolution:-After understanding how one-to-many and many-to-one realtionships work, I was able to implement it properly.
